   <h2 class="pageID">About Us</h2>
	
<p>Our staff healers are Reiki Masters with many years’ experience. We are trained in the traditional Usui method of healing. Our practitioners integrate Reiki as a part of our natural intuitive abilities. Each session is situated to best assist each recipient with the highest experience for each individual client, be it human or animal. We have been providing Reiki treatments for pets and people our practice since 2001.</p>
<p>The word Reiki is made of two Japanese words - Rei which means "God's Wisdom or the Higher Power" and Ki which is "life force energy". Reiki is actually "spiritually guided life force energy."
Reiki is a Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation that also promotes healing.</p> 
<p>The treatement is administered by "laying on hands" and is based on the idea that an unseen "life force energy" flows through us and is what causes us to be alive. If one's "life force energy" is low, then we are more likely to get sick or feel stress, and if it is high, we are more capable of being happy and healthy.</p>
<p>Animals, especially cats, are naturally receptive to the Reiki energy and tend to gravitate towards it readily. Some pets may initially prefer to experience the energy from a slight distance, rather than having the practitioner’s hands directly on them. Treatments for cats are done much in the same way as you would treat a human. A cat will let you know if he/she is receptive. Allow your intuition to guide you when approaching an animal – that cat will let you know whether he/she is receptive or not.</p>
<p>Our philosophy is that life is a journey. We are live ours daily and learn through the daily experiences we have, helping all around us. As a result, we become more compassionate and caring. Healing is a gift to all in the world.</p>
<p>The joy of working with energy is that it is something we can experience and learn from. The Eastern focus on the energy system is that the body, mind and spirit are One. Spirit is One.</p>
